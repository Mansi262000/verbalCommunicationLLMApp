# AI-Powered Speech & Storytelling Feedback

This project provides AI-based feedback for speech and storytelling using Whisper for speech recognition and Mistral (Ollama) for natural language processing.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the required dependencies:



```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers langchain_community sqlite3 streamlit
```

### Model Download
The required models will be automatically downloaded when running the `config.py` script:

```bash
python config.py
```

## Optimization Choices

- **GPU Utilization**: The application automatically detects CUDA availability to accelerate processing.
- **Caching**: Frequently used responses are cached to improve efficiency.
- **Retry Mechanism**: In case of timeouts, the model retries with a smaller batch size.
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Noise removal is performed before transcription for improved accuracy.

## Usage Examples

### Running the Application
Launch the Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Sample Input & Output
#### Text Feedback
**Input:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

**Output:**
```
Feedback: Your sentence is clear and well-structured. However, consider varying sentence length for better engagement.
Scores: {"Clarity": 9, "Tone": 8, "Engagement": 7}
Tips: Try using more dynamic vocabulary.
```

#### Audio Feedback
Upload or record an audio clip to receive transcription and feedback.
